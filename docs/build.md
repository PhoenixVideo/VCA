# Building instructions

The software is tested mostly in Linux and Windows OS. It requires some pre-requisite software to be installed before compiling. The steps to build the project in Linux and Windows are explained below.

## Prerequisites

 1. [CMake](https://cmake.org) version 3.13 or higher.
 2. [Git](https://git-scm.com/).
 3. C++ compiler with C++11 support
 4. [NASM](https://nasm.us/) assembly compiler (for x86 SIMD support)

The following C++11 compilers have been known to work:

 * Visual Studio 2015 or later
 * GCC 4.8 or later
 * Clang 3.3 or later

## Execute Build

The following commands will checkout the project source code and create a directory called 'build' where the compiler output will be placed. CMake is then used for generating build files and compiling the VCA binaries.

    $ git clone https://github.com/cd-athena/VCA.git
    $ cd VCA
    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake ../
    $ cmake --build .

This will create VCA binaries in the VCA/build/source/apps/ folder.

## Locate the Executable

After building with the above instructions, the executable is located at the directory path `vca_root/build/source/apps/vca`.
